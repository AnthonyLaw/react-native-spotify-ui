# react-native-spotify-ui
Pure javascript prototype of iOS Facebook UI for React Native framework. This demo only includes the landing page. 
I will add more views in the future.

##Inspiration
I was always amazed by the amazing Spotify UI, and I decided to challenge myself. THe pulling drawer from the bottom was the hardest challenge--
there are so many bugs to combinate pan-responder with other components. Buttons do not respond with PanResponder. If anyone knows a fix, please message me! 

The design aspect of this demo belong to <b>Spotify</b>.
